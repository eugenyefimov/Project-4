# AWS Cloud Security Framework

This project implements a comprehensive security framework for AWS cloud environments, following best practices and compliance requirements.

## Overview

The AWS Cloud Security Framework provides a structured approach to implementing security controls across AWS accounts. It includes:

- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Network Security with Security Groups
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS Protection with AWS Shield
- Threat Detection with GuardDuty
- Compliance Monitoring with AWS Config

## Architecture

The security framework is implemented using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, allowing for consistent, repeatable deployments across multiple environments.

## Components

### IAM Module
- Secure user management with least privilege principles
- MFA enforcement
- Password policies
- Admin and read-only user groups

### Security Groups Module
- Layered network security
- Restricted access to sensitive resources
- Bastion host configuration for secure access

### WAF Module
- Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Geo-restriction capabilities
- SQL injection protection

### Shield Module
- DDoS protection for critical resources
- Automatic notification of attacks
- Integration with CloudWatch for monitoring

### GuardDuty Module
- Continuous threat monitoring
- Automated notifications for suspicious activities
- Integration with CloudWatch Events

### AWS Config Module
- Continuous compliance monitoring
- Security best practice rules
- Automated notifications for non-compliant resources

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform v1.0.0 or later
- An S3 bucket for Terraform state (optional)

### Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Update the `terraform.tfvars` file with your specific configuration
3. Initialize Terraform:

## Compliance

This framework helps meet requirements for:
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
- GDPR
- HIPAA
- PCI DSS

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks:
1. Review IAM users and permissions
2. Monitor GuardDuty findings
3. Address AWS Config non-compliant resources
4. Update WAF rules as new threats emerge
5. Review security group rules periodically
